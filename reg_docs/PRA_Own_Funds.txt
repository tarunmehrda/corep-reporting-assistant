PRA Rulebook - Own Funds Requirements

The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) requires UK banks to maintain adequate own funds to ensure financial stability and protect depositors. Own funds represent the bank's capital base and serve as a buffer against unexpected losses.

CET1 Capital Components:
- Ordinary share capital: Common shares issued by the bank that fully absorb losses
- Retained earnings: Accumulated profits that have not been distributed to shareholders
- Other comprehensive income: Equity reserves from unrealized gains and losses

Regulatory Deductions from CET1:
- Intangible assets: Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and other intangible assets
- Deferred tax assets: Tax assets that may not be realizable in stress scenarios
- Investments in own instruments: Holdings of own capital instruments

AT1 Capital:
- Contingent convertible bonds (CoCos): Instruments that convert to equity or are written down in stress
- Other instruments that meet specific criteria for loss absorption

Tier 2 Capital:
- Subordinated debt: Debt instruments with lower priority than senior debt
- General provisions: Reserves for potential losses on banking assets

Reporting Requirements:
- All amounts must be reported in GBP for UK banks
- Template C 01.00 must be completed quarterly
- Regulatory references must be maintained for audit purposes
- Data gaps must be identified and explained
