CRR Article 36 - Regulatory Deductions from CET1

Article 36 of the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) specifies the deductions that must be made from Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. These deductions ensure the quality and consistency of CET1 capital across institutions.

Mandatory Deductions from CET1:

1. Intangible assets (Row 350):
   - Goodwill: Premium paid over fair value in business acquisitions
   - Mortgage servicing rights: Rights to service mortgage loans
   - Deferred tax assets related to temporary differences
   - Investments in own shares (treasury shares)
   - Defined benefit pension fund assets

2. Investments in financial sector entities:
   - Exceeding 10% of CET1 capital in single entity
   - Reciprocal holdings with other financial institutions
   - Must be deducted to prevent double counting of capital

3. Securitisation positions:
   - Exposures to securitisation tranches not meeting criteria
   - Significant risk transfer requirements not met
   - Must be deducted from CET1 capital

4. Credit risk transfer instruments:
   - Credit derivatives that do not meet risk transfer criteria
   - Guarantees that do not provide sufficient risk mitigation
   - Must be deducted if they do not effectively transfer risk

Specific Treatment of Intangible Assets:

Goodwill (Row 350):
- Must be deducted in full from CET1
- No partial recognition allowed
- Arises from business acquisitions
- Represents premium over fair value of identifiable assets

Deferred Tax Assets (Row 360):
